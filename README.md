# NLP


##Script repository for my NLP implementations.

###Contains (so far!):

1- N-gramas.py

Script to model stress patterns of Brazilian Portuguese using the ABG - Corpus as the data source and the probabilistic modelling of n-grams.


2- NBC.py 

Modelling stress patterns of Brazilian Portuguese using the ABG corpus through a naive bayes classifier.


3 - Transcritor.py / Transcr-TAB.csv

The python script is an automated way of transcribing a given word written in Portuguese to a representation of the way a speaker from the city of Sao Paulo would read it.
This includes several phonological processes, such as palatalization, epenthesis, syllabification and grapheme disambiguation.
The output form follows the phonological representation described on the Transcr-TAB file.


4 - Corpus ABG.csv

This table contains the compilated corpora of Brazilian Portugues that underlies my other applications.


### ISSUES

-Review the scripts
-Comment
-Port the scripts to Jupyter Notebooks.
